 		<p> <h1> In a land of firsts, what&#39;s it like?</h1>
		<i> First generation low-income high school students need more support when preparing and transitioning into college life </i>

		<p> According to the Center for First-Generation Student Success, as of the academic year 2015-16, 56% of undergraduates nationally were first-generation college students (neither parent had a bachelor&#39;s degree) (RTI International 2019). Moreover, 24% of first-generation college students had parents with no postsecondary education. Most surprisingly, about 90% of first-generation low-income students do not graduate within six years (EAB 2019). This is attributed to the unique challenges and the lack of awareness of the college resources available to first-generation low income (FLI) students as they begin their college experience. </p>

		<p> Indeed, there lacks conversations and resources for high school students, considering applying to college, to learn from and to avoid some of the struggles faced when transitioning into college. Once FLI high school students know about their options and what colleges have to offer, applying to them is easier and their transition less challenging. </p>

		<p> As Schlossberg's Theory of Transition notes a transition is described as any event, or non-event that results in changed relationships, routines, assumptions, and roles. The transition is defined by the person who experiences it and that individual&#39;s perception of the transition is more important than the transition itself (Schlossberg 1981). Thus in order to better prepare incoming FLI students, considering and going to college, there needs to be more done to facilitate and change false assumptions about what their transition will be like. </p>

		<p> While common rhetoric will label FLI students as less academically capable or socially disadvantaged, according to data from the Campus Labs Student Strengths Inventory (SSI), a survey conducted to more than a million students during orientation or the first weeks of the semester as they enter into their new environment, first generation students scored higher in academic engagement, educational commitment and campus engagement than non- first generation students (LaCount 2014). This evidence is clear, first generation students have the academic brains and will to succeed at the institution they choose, but need to know and feel that they will and can have access to the academic, financial, and community support of their college if needed. </p>

		<p> For example, while 65% of first generation students receive financial aid from their colleges, this is the only resource a higher percentage of first-generation students receive compared to non-first-generation students. First-gen students are using health services, academic advising and support services, and career services less than non-first-gen students. According to a first-generation student at Brown &#8220;while most students &#8220;feel entitled&#8221; to academic and emotional support, first-generation students, feel really guilty about taking advantage of resources&#8221; (NYT 2015). This is a problem. </p>

		<p> While a lot of work and support systems have been built to support FLI students already in college, there needs to be more done to support high school students thinking about going to college and their transition, so they can avoid and be better equipped to handle some of these challenges. We have to talk and share this information- demystify the college process that says &#8220;you can&#39;t do this because your parents didn&#39;t go to college&#8221; or &#8220;because you&#39;re low income you&#39;ll struggle that much more.&#8221; There is space for FLI students anywhere to hold and pursue their ambitions anywhere they want- they just have to know it. </p>

		<i> <a href="https://thepalantepodcast.buzzsprout.com/" style="color:#000000;">The Pa&#39;lante Podcast</a> informs, demystifies and smooths the transition process for first-gen high school students considering going to college through storytelling. </i>

		<p> According to an NCES report from 2018, recent figures show a third of college students are first-generation. About 90% of them are low-income students who do not graduate within six years (EAB 2019). It is clear there is a disconnect happening for first-generation students in high school transitioning to college. First-generation students are the firsts in their families to attend college and receive a four-year degree. Indeed, as Shabeha Haque, a guest on The Pa&#39;lante Podcast and first-generation student at George Washington University notes, &#8220;it is a bit different, but I think one of the main similarities is we just had to find ways to finesse the system in a way that worked for us and in a way that benefitted us to make sure we were given the benefits we deserve being in higher education.&#8221; First-generation students like Shabeha are often times navigating the path towards college blindly and supporting themselves with the resources they have available to them. If you are low income or first generation American it is even more difficult to get to college and find the resources you need. </p>

		<p> Thus the Pa&#39;lante Podcast was made to inform, demystify and smoothen the transition process for first-gen high school students considering going to college through storytelling. The podcast does this in order to combat the lack of conversations and resources for first-gen high school students considering going to college. As the founder of The Pa&#39;lante Podcast and first-generation student myself, my goal is clear: to inform first-generation low income (FLI) students about their options and what colleges have to offer. As the firsts in our families to attend college no one&#39;s told us how it&#39;s done, The Pa&#39;lante Podcast does just that through the rich and diverse voices of first-generation college students who have done it and are still climbing.</p>

		<p> The podcast is currently available on all mainstream podcast channels and can also be accessed on its website. While the podcast has been received by a lot of support and love from the community and has seen downloads in ten states and forty-one cities; the real measurement of success will come not in the short run but rather the medium and long run when FLI students transition into college, graduate from college, and continue to pay it forward. </p>

		<p>In a country where, 71 percent of the U.S. foreign-born population aged 25 and over do not hold a college degree, first-generation students like Shabeha, Augustine Jimenez, and other guests on The Pa&#39;lante Podcast, represent the American Dreams of their families.  Indeed, as Augustine Jimenez, a first-generation student at Boston University and guest on the podcast notes, &#8220;being from that low income minority background my mother didn&#39;t really have a way of relating to that experience of applying to college, she didn&#39;t understand it outside of this practical &#8220;it&#39;s a means to a good career. It&#39;s how we&#39;re going to progress as a family- socioeconomically speaking.&#8221; We are the daughters and sons of restaurant workers, fast food cooks, nail salon workers, house cleaners and the workers uplifting the country; and we all deserve the opportunity to an education and to pursue our dreams and aspirations. </p>
