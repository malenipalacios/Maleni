			<p> 4 words, utility, a bed, a window - you <br /> 
			your thoughts and dreams and questions <br /> 
			circle and leave the room, however, <br /> 
			you remain still<br /> 
		    </p>

			<p> the open outside, the ground, the air - you <br /> 
			your anxiety, worries, and hesitations <br /> 
			leave just us showing - they arrived <br /> 
			and you still remain <br /> 
			</p>

			<p> what's in your heads is not all that is<br /> 
			the actions, the movements, are <br /> 
			and also make you<br /> 
			utility is an embodiment of all <br />

			<p> My ground and teacher, the one who taught me everything <br /> 
			Culture, authenticity, humbleness, charm and coolness <br /> 
			Intellect and the storytelling of real pain and perseverance. <br /> 
			Ours is a story of transcendence, the development of a leader<br /> 
		    </p>

			<p> My soul and complement, everything that I spoke to the universe of<br /> 
			An artist, gifted with words and talent, a real person, sharp and mine <br /> 
			Distinct but too grounding and the perfect match <br /> 
			Ours is a story of partnership and eternal soul<br /> 
			</p>

			<p> My ocean, who’s waters give me all the love that will forever give<br /> 
			The grace, the calm and collected, the lady and best humanizer<br /> 
			Down to the seabed and up to the sun<br /> 
			Ours is a story of unconditional love, so much of it, that I now give from our well. <br />
			</p> 

			<p> My moon, amidst it all there lies compassion, respect, a deep love<br /> 
			An appreciation for the other, an understanding, a hunger for the new and old<br />
			Beauty beyond me, gumption and character, a unique grace<br /> 
			Ours is a story of companionship, familial links that can never be broken<br />
			</p> 


			<p> My one and only. Constants in my life.<br /> 
			Iterating, humanizing, cultivating, making anew and afresh<br />
			All the love that I hold for my abc’s… <br /> 
			Giving me this magical carpet ride. <br />

			<p> Sometimes growing up hurts. <br /> 
			Let’s honor slowness. <br /> 
			Make peace with time <br /> 
			Make a generous offering <br /> 
		    </p>

			<p> We are an integral whole. <br /> 
			We. As in everything on the Earth.   <br /> 
			And with that <br /> 
			You can’t be free of pain if others are in pain <br /> 
			</p>

			<p> Always opening new doors. <br /> 
			We rise by lifting others.  <br /> 
			We rise ... <br /> 
			We rise ...  <br />

			<p> ‘The elementary basics’ they cry out <br /> 
			‘yes I agree’, but how do you maintain the basics <br />
			when so much rhetoric about the complex system is taking place <br /> 
			</p>

			<p>
			how do you reconcile both? That is the question of our time <br />
			the question of our time that some know the answer to <br />
			but refuse to share for lack of a cut <br />
			</p>

			<p>
			that’s the paradox. I don’t know if I should feel sad for them <br />
			or what message I should convey to the others <br />
			for after all, it’s not all harmonious as it is perceived <br />
			</p>

			<p>
			so what then is the answer, does it just flow, is it a part of time <br />
			rendering all of its implications and just following suit <br />
			feelings of care, of betterment, or prosperity all get jumbled up in my head <br />
			</p>

			<p>
			yet here we are barely a quarter in, three more to go <br />
			much time to begin to understand it, much time to talk to others <br />
			about the elementary basics. <br />

			<p> It could have been worse <br /> 
			It could be worse <br /> 
			So what’s the trouble <i> mama? </i> <br /> 
			Perspective, it’s all about perspective <br /> 
		    </p>

			<p> Focus your gaze, do what you can, <br /> 
			And hope for the best. <br /> 
			It could be worse, much worse. <br /> 
			Living, but you are <br /> 
			</p>

			<p> If you’re not dying your living. <br /> 
			It’s all about perspective. <br /> 
			In the meantime, give me your art <br /> 
			Give me your story, <br />
			</p> 

			<p> Give me a piece of which I, we <br /> 
			Can remember you by, that is <br /> 
			Every person’s gift, to the world <br /> 
			No one can take that away from you <br /> 
			</p>

			<p> So give me your art, because it could have <br /> 
			Been worse. But it is right now, take a breath, <br /> 
			And let’s keep it moving <i> mama? </i> <br /> 
			Give me your 5 minutes. <br />
