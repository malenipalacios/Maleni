	<li> Zapateados are my ultimate favorite, no question. I've inherited the ear for them from the men in my life. Papa, grandfather. In regards to how they've become mainstream, bbeing the picky, detail oriented person, well not super happy at how they're becoming a sort of fetish. There is a grace and flow that should come when dancing zapateados calentanos. One's feet should never really touch the floor. Using your teepy toes to move to the flow of the drums. Using the hands to caress the air as you turn and move with your partner. This is my two cents on zapateados. Here are some pretty ethinc true zapateados from tierra caliente:
